# Goal

Teach / show people how to refactor legacy code, but before they even begin, how to take a snapshot of the current situation first using approval testing. The example used here is based on the well-known [Gilded Rose kata by Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata), but then in the updated version of [Gil Gon√ßalves](https://github.com/LuRsT/gilded_rose_kata).

## Coverage

The generated HTML coverage reports can easily be inspected by

```bash
$ cd htmlcov
$ python -m http.server 8000
```
